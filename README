# JavaScript DirecTV Remote API

The purpose of this project is to provide a full-fledged JavaScript API for
interacting with compatible [DirecTV](http://www.directv.com) set-top-boxes
(STB).  Sometime back in 2010, possibly earlier, DirecTV started shipping
their STBs with an HTTP API that allows some very basic functionality, like
issuing remote commands.  The big problem is that this API isn't
public/official and it is horribly documented.  Not only that but most
attempts at creating a real library around this API has either been done
behind closed doors or it's been done as simple little one-off scripts to
add some minimal functionality to your favorite open source media center.
That being said, I hope that this project helps fill the gaps and also opens
the eyes of DirecTV to the fact that having documented, full access to their
SHEF API could be mutually beneficial to themselves but also to thirdparty
software developers.
